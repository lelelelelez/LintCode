### 853. Car Fleet

#### 题目

题目地址：https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/

`N` cars are going to the same destination along a one lane road.  The destination is `target` miles away.

Each car `i` has a constant speed `speed[i]` (in miles per hour), and initial position `position[i]` miles towards the target along the road.

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it, and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed.

The distance between these two cars is ignored - they are assumed to have the same position.

A *car fleet* is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed.  Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

How many car fleets will arrive at the destination?

**Example 1:**

```shell
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 and 8 become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 doesn't catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 and 3 become a fleet, meeting each other at 6.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
```

**Note:**

1. `0 <= N <= 10 ^ 4`
2. `0 < target <= 10 ^ 6`
3. `0 < speed[i] <= 10 ^ 6`
4. `0 <= position[i] < target`
5. All initial positions are different.

#### 题目解析

这道题目的大意是一群车在一条路上，赶往同一个目的地，如果多个车是一起到达目的地，称之为一个车队。只有一辆车一个人到达，也为一个车队。最关键的是 后面的车不能超过前面的车，在超过前车的时候，与之同行。

所以可以把每辆车到达终点的时间算出来，如果后面的车的时间到达终点的时间小于等于前面的车，那么它们一定是一个车队。

记得要把时间保留小数

#### 代码实现

```python
class Solution(object):
    def carFleet(self, target, position, speed):
        """
        :type target: int
        :type position: List[int]
        :type speed: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        t = []
        for i in range(0, len(position)):
            a = float(target - position[i])/float(speed[i])
            t.append((-position[i], round(a, 6))) #保留足够的小数位数！！
        t.sort()    
        ans, max_t = 0, 0    
        for p, t in t:
            if t > max_t:
                ans += 1
                max_t = t
        return ans
```

时间复杂度O(n)

可以使用`zip()`函数优化代码

```python
class Solution(object):
    def carFleet(self, target, position, speed):
        """
        :type target: int
        :type position: List[int]
        :type speed: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        target = float(target)
        total = 0
        last = -1
        for position, speed in sorted(zip(position,speed),reverse=True):
            time = (target - position) / speed
            if time > last:
                last = time
                total += 1
        return total
```

`zip()`

**zip()** 函数用于将可迭代的对象作为参数，将对象中对应的元素打包成一个个元组，然后返回由这些元组组成的列表。

```shell
zip([iterable, ...])
>>>a = [1,2,3]
>>> b = [4,5,6]
>>> c = [4,5,6,7,8]
>>> zipped = zip(a,b)     # 打包为元组的列表
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
>>> zip(a,c)              # 元素个数与最短的列表一致
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
>>> zip(*zipped)          # 与 zip 相反，*zipped 可理解为解压，返回二维矩阵式
[(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)]
```
